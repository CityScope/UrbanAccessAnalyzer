        "\n",
        "## 📖 Overview\n",
        "This notebook provides a data-driven framework to evaluate **how easily residents can access public transit services** within a city.\n",
        "\n",
        "By analyzing GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) schedules and the local street network, we generate an \"Accessibility Score.\" Unlike simple proximity maps, this analysis evaluates the **Level of Service (LoS)** at each stop, accounting for frequency (headway), transit mode (rail vs. bus), and travel speed. \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📊 Evaluation Criteria: Quality & Proximity\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis uses a multi-dimensional scoring system to determine the final **accessibility** score. We evaluate transit stops based on two main pillars:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Stop Quality\n",
        "A stop's intrinsic quality is determined by:\n",
        "*   **Headway:** How long users have to wait for the next vehicle.\n",
        "*   **Speed:** How fast the transit service moves once on board.\n",
        "*   **Mode:** The perceived \"comfort\" or \"reliability\" factor (e.g., Rail > Tram > Bus).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Walk Proximity\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quality functions \n",
        "\n",
        "To reflect real-world human behavior, we apply **Elasticity** values to our scoring. Elasticity defines the exponential decay of perceived quality as conditions worsen and can be found in common transport economy studies:\n",
        "*   **Headway Elasticity:** As wait times increase, the utility of the stop drops exponentially.\n",
        "*   **Walk Elasticity:** As the walking distance to a stop increases, its accessibility score decreases.\n",
        "*   **Speed Elasticity:** As transit speed increases, the quality of the service improves.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Discretization:** Results are automatically binned into 10 accessibility levels, ranging from 0 (Poor/No Access) to 1 (Excellent Access).\n",
